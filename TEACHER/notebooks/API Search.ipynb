    "\n",
    "[Chronicling America](https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov) is a website hosting America's historic newspaper pages from 1777-1963, the U.S. Newspaper Directory of American newspapers published between 1690-present and other resources, so that information within them can be made easily publicly accessbile to online users via search.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is what the website looked like when I accessed it last.  When you will access, it will look slightly differently, in that the presented content will be more relevant to the date when you'll access the page, but structure wise it will look very roughly the same.\n",

    "## 2. Conventional Search\n",
    "\n",
    "Websites which can be accessed using conventional search have a search bar. We are all very familiar with such conventional search as most of know how to search things on Google. To enable conventional search, Cronicling America needs something like a **search engine** under hood of its website. Instead of accessing the whole World Wide Web, Cronicling America's search engine is limited to the digigitised collections it provides access to.\n",
    "\n",
    "The way this works is that all the data, so all the text in the newspaper pages is indexed, i.e. it is stored in a large **search index**.  A search index can be thought of a bit like a structured encyclopedia.  So when you look for (or query) a word, it is looked up in the index which can then easily retrieve all documents (e.g. newspaper pages) that are relevant to the query.  In the case of Chronicling America, the images of the newspaper pages are also stored along with the text.  So when you look for words, the results are displayed as highlighting in relevant documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, see the results for the search \"little alacrity and energy\" below.\n",

    "## API Search\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is an API\n",
    "\n",
    "API is the acronym for Application Programming Interface which is a complicated way of saying that it's an interace between two applications or between a human and an application or database.  It's a bit like a waiter in a restaurant.  You know how to talk to them to order food and pay the bill and they are the interface between you and the restaurant shielding you for all the complicated stuff that's going on behind the scenes, including food deliveries, managing stock, cooking and cleaning dishes.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of search, an API is a way to access data systematically using structured queries. A search API allows you to search existing items in a data collection or catalogue, for example, in the historical newspaper collections hosted on Chronicling America. In this case, the search API is the interface to the data and you just need to learn how to communicate with it to get the right information back, i.e. to return newspaper pages that are relevant to your search query.\n",
    "\n",
    "A search API allows you to execute a search query using a URL and get back results that match the query. In that sense it's not that different to conventional search. You just need to learn how the search query URLs are constructed to do the search (instead of typing it and clicking \"Go\"). The other difference is that with an API, rather than results being just displayed in your browser, you can often specify to download them immediately onto your computer in different formats.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's see how it works in action."

    "## Chronicling America API\n",
    "\n",
    "### Simple Text Search\n",
    "\n",
    "All Chronicling API searches start with the following base URL: https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/ \n",
    "\n",
    "The base URL is followed by the search, including specific search parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "E.g. a simple search for articles containing the word \"alacrity\" is made up of the base URL https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/ and \"search/titles/results/?andtext=alacrity\", so:\n",
    "\n",
    "https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/search/titles/results/?andtext=alacrity\n",
    "\n",
    "`/search/titles/results` specifies where to search more specifically and everything after the question mark specifies the search query and parameters. In this case, we want to search the text of the newspapers, which is done by using `andtext` set to our search term \"alacrity\" (`andtext=alacrity`).\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also search the newspaper titles only, but we are interested in searching the text in all of the newspapers in this lesson.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Proximate Search\n",
    "\n",
    "The conventional simple Chronicling America browser search carries out a proximate search when your query contains multiple words.  This means that all words specified are searched within each page, but they don't need to appear one after the other, even if you put them in double quotes.  You should have noticed that when inspecting the results of the conventional search, as one page didn't contain the exact search query.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the API, proximate search can be replicated using the `proxtext` search parameter and using plus signs between multiple words.  So, the API search for the equivalent browser search for \"little alacrity and energy\" is:\n",
    "\n",
    "https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/search/pages/results/&proxtext=little+alacrity+and+energy\n",
    "\n",
    "If you click on this link, a new tab should open which contains all seven results you looked at earlier.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Phrase Text Search\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also do a search for the exact phrase by using the `phrasetext` parameter, like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/search/pages/results/?phrasetext=little+alacrity+and+energy\n",
    "\n",
    "Note, this only returns the six correct pages containing the phrase but not the page which contains all four individual words but not in the exact phrase specified.  You can achieve the same in the browser search by going to \"Advanced Search\" and running a search with the phrase \"little alacrity and energy\".\n",
    "\n",
    "But hang on, what's so special about API searches, if I can do the exact same thing in the browser? What are they useful for?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Different Formats and Downloading Results\n",
    "\n",
    "The most useful thing about Search APIs is that they often allow you to download the data in a specified format so that you can do further analysis with it.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Chronicling America API allows you to return results in html format by default if you don't specify a format, which means the results are displayed in a new tab in your browser.  So, nothing new there.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, it also allows you to have the results in json or atom format.  This way you can download them to your computer or into your notebok for further analysis, e.g., if you want to do Regular Expression search to find strings in the text or even for sentiment analysis of the text.\n",
    "\n",
    "**json:** ... JavaScript Object Notation (json) is a standard text-based format for representing structured data based on JavaScript object syntax. It is commonly used for transmitting data in web applications (e.g., sending data from the server to the client, so it can be displayed on a web page, or vice versa).  In our case, it's used to store all the results for a search query.\n",
    "\n",
    "**atom:** ... atom is the name of an XML-based Web content and metadata syndication format, and an application-level protocol for publishing and editing Web resources belonging to periodically updated websites. So, atom is a type of XML format but we don't use it in this lesson.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll be working with the results in json format. For example, our previous query requesting the results in json looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/search/pages/results/?phrasetext=little+alacrity+and+energy&format=json"

When you call the final `json_results` variable (rather than printing it) then you can see the results in slightly better formatting.\n",

We use the `findall()` function to find all mentions of \"alacrity\".  \n",

    "- `.*` means zero or more characters\n",
    "- `[^\\n]` means not a newline character\n",
